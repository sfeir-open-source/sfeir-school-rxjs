# Exercises

To run exercises, you have to go to "exercises" directory, run `npm install` to init the dependancies.

⚠️ You have to use Node 11+ to execute thoses exercises because some of the function used in javascript require node 11.

## Run exercises

To run an exercise, you can first `npm run tsc XXX/FILE.ts` and after `node XXX/FILE.js` or run the script corresponding to exercise:

- `npm run 00`
- `npm run 0-intro`
- `npm run 1-sequences`
- `npm run 2-Observable`
- `npm run 3-RxObservable`

## Solutions

Each directory has a solution.ts file that contains the solution of exercice. You can test it by running `npx jest`
